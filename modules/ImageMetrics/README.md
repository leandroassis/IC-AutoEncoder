# ImageMetrics

This repository has implementations of some image metrics made with TensorFlow. 

## 3-SSIM 

This function is a modification of SSIM (structural similarity index measure), described in the following article:

## PSNRB

- Obs: This function is an adapted version of the PSNR-B implemented in SEWAR lib, modified for operating over a batch of images. The original function is implemented with Numpy, which made it incompatible with the graph execution. Furthermore, the function was made to operate over 2 images, instead of two batches of images. \\

This Metric is also a modified version of the PSNR, which was a famous metric, in that case, applied for images. The modification consists of an addition of a measure of blocking effects, caused by compression. Details are described in the article:
